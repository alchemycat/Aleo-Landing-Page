						Compared to other blockchains, Aleo uses the rare "Zero null Edge"

						The financial incentive will always be there for The Aleo Foundation

						What Aleo gains by having first-mover advantage on a PoW function
						that is functionally equivalent to work that is inexorably linked to
						the processing of SNARKs, is assurances that the most efficient
						place on the planet for the processing of “SNARK Work” will be the
						Aleo mining pool itself. Once dedicated hardware (ASICs) begin to be
						iteratively developed for the mining of Aleo, these units will
						become the most efficient processing units for blockchain SNARK
						work, and therefore presumably if anyone wants to produce
						zero-knowledge proofs, that work may well be done on an Aleo ASIC.
						As a result, Aleo miners will perform SNARK-work and mining based on
						demand and profitability of both.
