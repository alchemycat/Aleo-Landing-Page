                    What Aleo gains by having first-mover advantage on a PoW function that
                    is functionally equivalent to work that is inexorably linked to the
                    processing of SNARKs, is assurances that the most efficient place on the
                    planet for the processing of “SNARK Work” will be the Aleo mining pool
                    itself. Once dedicated hardware (ASICs) begin to be iteratively
                    developed for the mining of Aleo, these units will become the most
                    efficient processing units for blockchain SNARK work, and therefore
                    presumably if anyone wants to produce zero-knowledge proofs, that work
                    may well be done on an Aleo ASIC. As a result, Aleo miners will perform
                    SNARK-work and mining based on demand and profitability of both.

                    Thus,
                    Aleo’s economics imply that the native Aleo currency will become an
                    economic index that tracks the value of zero-knowledge proofs and their
                    applications.
