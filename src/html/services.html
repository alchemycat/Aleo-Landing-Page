                        Rather than risk leaking a user's password, users can now hash their password (with salt and pepper) on-device, without ever having to send their password over to any web service.

                        Brokerages today not only learn the complete history of a user’s transactions, they also learn when a user performs a trade. Access to this data allows brokerages to sell valuable information to third parties, choose to deny service to specific users, and even front run their own users on exchange.

                        If a brokerage can’t learn their users’ data, they cannot target any one user - whether to deny them service or offer an unfair price. The choice of handing data over should be one that users get to make.
