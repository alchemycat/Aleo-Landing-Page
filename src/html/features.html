						Compared to other blockchains, Aleo uses the rare "Zero null Edge"
						techlogology, which makes it not only safer than other blockchains
						but also allows it to easily combine its web services with others.

						Aleo creates unique decentralized applications in which it will be
						impossible to track users (their activity, transactions, balance
						amounts, etc.) and transfer their confidential information to third

						The newest algorithm of work – Proof of Succinct Work (PoSW).It is a
						variant of Bitcoin's SHA-based difficulty adjusting algorithm, with
						the key difference being that the underlying computation is not an
						arbitrary hash function but rather a proof of knowledge.
