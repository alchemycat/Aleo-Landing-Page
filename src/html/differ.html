                    Aleo’s tokenomics is built on a private-by-default, open-source, and web-based blockchain that is designed to protect user data.
                    <br><br>
                    Its token, ALEO, is used as the primary utility and governance token within the Aleo ecosystem. It allows users to access personalized web services without giving up control of their private data.
