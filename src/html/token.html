							A token burn is a process where a certain percentage of the tokens
							are permanently removed from circulation, reducing the total supply

							Staking their tokens, users are rewarded with a percentage of the
							transaction fees on the network. This creates an incentive for users
							to hold onto their tokens and participate in the network, rather
							than selling them off.

							The staking mechanism also helps to increase the security of the
							network, as it ensures that there are enough tokens being staked to
							validate transactions.

							incentive for developers to build on the platform, which in turn
